# Biodiversity Analysis
The purpose of this dashboard is to allow individuals that participated in a belly button biodiversity study to view their results by selecting their anonymized Test Subject ID Number.<br/><br/>

Participants are able to view their demographic information as well as their results for the top 10 bacteria cultures found, bacteria cultures per sample and belly button washing frequency. <br/><br/>
